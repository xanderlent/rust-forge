    <div class="content"><p>This page defines the best practices procedure for making bug fixes or
soundness corrections in the compiler that can cause existing code to
stop compiling. This text is based on
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rust-lang/rfcs/master/text/1589-rustc-bug-fix-procedure.md">RFC 1589</a>.</p>

<h1 id="motivation">Motivation</h1>

<p>From time to time, we encounter the need to make a bug fix, soundness
correction, or other change in the compiler which will cause existing
code to stop compiling. When this happens, it is important that we
handle the change in a way that gives users of Rust a smooth
transition. What we want to avoid is that existing programs suddenly
stop compiling with opaque error messages: we would prefer to have a
gradual period of warnings, with clear guidance as to what the problem
is, how to fix it, and why the change was made. This RFC describes the
procedure that we have been developing for handling breaking changes
that aims to achieve that kind of smooth transition.</p>

<p>One of the key points of this policy is that (a) warnings should be
issued initially rather than hard errors if at all possible and (b)
every change that causes existing code to stop compiling will have an
associated tracking issue. This issue provides a point to collect
feedback on the results of that change. Sometimes changes have
unexpectedly large consequences or there may be a way to avoid the
change that was not considered.  In those cases, we may decide to
change course and roll back the change, or find another solution (if
warnings are being used, this is particularly easy to do).</p>

<h3 id="what-qualifies-as-a-bug-fix">What qualifies as a bug fix?</h3>

<p>Note that this RFC does not try to define when a breaking change is
permitted. That is already covered under <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1122-language-semver.md">RFC 1122</a>. This document
assumes that the change being made is in accordance with those
policies. Here is a summary of the conditions from RFC 1122:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Soundness changes:</strong> Fixes to holes uncovered in the type system.</li>
  <li><strong>Compiler bugs:</strong> Places where the compiler is not implementing the
specified semantics found in an RFC or lang-team decision.</li>
  <li><strong>Underspecified language semantics:</strong> Clarifications to grey areas
where the compiler behaves inconsistently and no formal behavior had
been previously decided.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please see <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1122-language-semver.md">the RFC</a> for full details!</p>

<h1 id="detailed-design">Detailed design</h1>

<p>The procedure for making a breaking change is as follows (each of
these steps is described in more detail below):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Do a <strong>crater run</strong> to assess the impact of the change.</li>
  <li>Make a <strong>special tracking issue</strong> dedicated to the change.</li>
  <li>Do not report an error right away. Instead, <strong>issue
forwards-compatibility lint warnings</strong>.
    <ul>
      <li>Sometimes this is not straightforward. See the text below for
suggestions on different techniques we have employed in the past.</li>
      <li>For cases where warnings are infeasible:
        <ul>
          <li>Report errors, but make every effort to give a targeted error
message that directs users to the tracking issue</li>
          <li>Submit PRs to all known affected crates that fix the issue
            <ul>
              <li>or, at minimum, alert the owners of those crates to the problem
and direct them to the tracking issue</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Once the change has been in the wild for at least one cycle, we can
<strong>stabilize the change</strong>, converting those warnings into errors.</li>
</ol>

<p>Finally, for changes to libsyntax that will affect plugins, the
general policy is to batch these changes. That is discussed below in
more detail.</p>

<h3 id="tracking-issue">Tracking issue</h3>

<p>Every breaking change should be accompanied by a <strong>dedicated tracking
issue</strong> for that change. The main text of this issue should describe
the change being made, with a focus on what users must do to fix their
code. The issue should be approachable and practical; it may make
sense to direct users to an RFC or some other issue for the full
details. The issue also serves as a place where users can comment with
questions or other concerns.</p>

<p>A template for these breaking-change tracking issues can be found
below. An example of how such an issue should look can be
<a href="https://gist.github.com/nikomatsakis/631ec8b4af9a18b5d062d9d9b7d3d967">found here</a>.</p>

<p>The issue should be tagged with (at least) <code class="highlighter-rouge">B-unstable</code> and
<code class="highlighter-rouge">T-compiler</code>.</p>

<h3 id="tracking-issue-template">Tracking issue template</h3>

<p>This is a template to use for tracking issues:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>This is the **summary issue** for the `YOUR_LINT_NAME_HERE`
future-compatibility warning and other related errors. The goal of
this page is describe why this change was made and how you can fix
code that is affected by it. It also provides a place to ask questions
or register a complaint if you feel the change should not be made. For
more information on the policy around future-compatibility warnings,
see our [breaking change policy guidelines][guidelines].

[guidelines]: LINK_TO_THIS_RFC

#### What is the warning for?

*Describe the conditions that trigger the warning and how they can be
fixed. Also explain why the change was made.**

#### When will this warning become a hard error?
                    
At the beginning of each 6-week release cycle, the Rust compiler team
will review the set of outstanding future compatibility warnings and
nominate some of them for **Final Comment Period**. Toward the end of
the cycle, we will review any comments and make a final determination
whether to convert the warning into a hard error or remove it
entirely.

<h3 id="issuing-future-compatibility-warnings">Issuing future compatibility warnings</h3>

<p>The best way to handle a breaking change is to begin by issuing
future-compatibility warnings. These are a special category of lint
warning. Adding a new future-compatibility warning can be done as
follows.</p>

<h4 id="helpful-techniques">Helpful techniques</h4>

<p>It can often be challenging to filter out new warnings from older,
pre-existing errors. One technique that has been used in the past is
to run the older code unchanged and collect the errors it would have
reported. You can then issue warnings for any errors you would give
which do not appear in that original set. Another option is to abort
compilation after the original code completes if errors are reported:
then you know that your new code will only execute when there were no
errors before.</p>

<h4 id="crater-and-cratesio">Crater and crates.io</h4>

<p>We should always do a crater run to assess impact. It is polite and
considerate to at least notify the authors of affected crates the
breaking change.  If we can submit PRs to fix the problem, so much the
better.</p>

<h4 id="is-it-ever-acceptable-to-go-directly-to-issuing-errors">Is it ever acceptable to go directly to issuing errors?</h4>

<p>Changes that are believed to have negligible impact can go directly to
issuing an error. One rule of thumb would be to check against
<code class="highlighter-rouge">crates.io</code>: if fewer than 10 <strong>total</strong> affected projects are found
(<strong>not</strong> root errors), we can move straight to an error. In such
cases, we should still make the “breaking change” page as before, and
we should ensure that the error directs users to this page. In other
words, everything should be the same except that users are getting an
error, and not a warning. Moreover, we should submit PRs to the
affected projects (ideally before the PR implementing the change lands
in rustc).</p>

<p>If the impact is not believed to be negligible (e.g., more than 10
crates are affected), then warnings are required (unless the compiler
team agrees to grant a special exemption in some particular case). If
implementing warnings is not feasible, then we should make an
aggressive strategy of migrating crates before we land the change so
as to lower the number of affected crates. Here are some techniques
for approaching this scenario:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Issue warnings for subparts of the problem, and reserve the new
errors for the smallest set of cases you can.</li>
  <li>Try to give a very precise error message that suggests how to fix
the problem and directs users to the tracking issue.</li>
  <li>It may also make sense to layer the fix:
    <ul>
      <li>First, add warnings where possible and let those land before proceeding
to issue errors.</li>
      <li>Work with authors of affected crates to ensure that corrected
versions are available <em>before</em> the fix lands, so that downstream
users can use them.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="stabilization">Stabilization</h3>

<p>After a change is made, we will <strong>stabilize</strong> the change using the same
process that we use for unstable features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>After a new release is made, we will go through the outstanding tracking
issues corresponding to breaking changes and nominate some of them for
<strong>final comment period</strong> (FCP).</li>
  <li>The FCP for such issues lasts for one cycle. In the final week or two of the cycle,
we will review comments and make a final determination:
    <ul>
      <li>Convert to error: the change should be made into a hard error.</li>
      <li>Revert: we should remove the warning and continue to allow the older code to compile.</li>
      <li>Defer: can’t decide yet, wait longer, or try other strategies.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally, breaking changes should have landed on the <strong>stable branch</strong>
of the compiler before they are finalized.</p>

<p><a name="guide"></a></p>

<h3 id="removing-a-lint">Removing a lint</h3>

<p>Once we have decided to make a “future warning” into a hard error, we
need a PR that removes the custom lint. As an example, here are the
steps required to remove the <code class="highlighter-rouge">overlapping_inherent_impls</code>
compatibility lint. First, convert the name of the lint to uppercase
(<code class="highlighter-rouge">OVERLAPPING_INHERENT_IMPLS</code>) ripgrep through the source for that
string. We will basically by converting each place where this lint
name is mentioned (in the compiler, we use the upper-case name, and a
macro automatically generates the lower-case string; so searching for
<code class="highlighter-rouge">overlapping_inherent_impls</code> would not find much).</p>

<h4 id="remove-the-lint">Remove the lint.</h4>

<p>The first reference you will likely find is the lint definition
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/085d71c3efe453863739c1fb68fd9bd1beff214f/src/librustc/lint/builtin.rs#L171-L175">in <code class="highlighter-rouge">librustc/lint/builtin.rs</code> that resembles this</a>:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nd">declare_lint!</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">pub</span> <span class="n">OVERLAPPING_INHERENT_IMPLS</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">Deny</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="c">// this may also say Warning</span>
    <span class="s">"two overlapping inherent impls define an item with the same name were erroneously allowed"</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This <code class="highlighter-rouge">declare_lint!</code> macro creates the relevant data
structures. Remove it. You will also find that there is a mention of
<code class="highlighter-rouge">OVERLAPPING_INHERENT_IMPLS</code> later in the file as
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/085d71c3efe453863739c1fb68fd9bd1beff214f/src/librustc/lint/builtin.rs#L252-L290">part of a <code class="highlighter-rouge">lint_array!</code></a>; remove it too,</p>

<p>Next, you see see
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/085d71c3efe453863739c1fb68fd9bd1beff214f/src/librustc_lint/lib.rs#L202-L205">a reference to <code class="highlighter-rouge">OVERLAPPING_INHERENT_IMPLS</code> in <code class="highlighter-rouge">librustc_lint/lib.rs</code></a>. This
defining the lint as a “future compatibility lint”:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">FutureIncompatibleInfo</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">id</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nn">LintId</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nf">of</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">OVERLAPPING_INHERENT_IMPLS</span><span class="p">),</span>
    <span class="n">reference</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">"issue #36889 &lt;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/36889&gt;"</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">},</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Remove this too.</p>

<h4 id="add-the-lint-to-the-list-of-removed-lists">Add the lint to the list of removed lists.</h4>

<p>In <code class="highlighter-rouge">src/librustc_lint/lib.rs</code> there is a list of “renamed and removed
lints”. You can add this lint to the list:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">store</span><span class="nf">.register_removed</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"overlapping_inherent_impls"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"converted into hard error, see #36889"</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>where <code class="highlighter-rouge">#36889</code> is the tracking issue for your lint.</p>

<h4 id="update-the-places-that-issue-the-lint">Update the places that issue the lint</h4>

<p>Finally, the last class of references you will see are the places that
actually <strong>trigger</strong> the lint itself (i.e., what causes the warnings
to appear). These you do not want to delete. Instead, you want to
convert them into errors. In this case, the
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/085d71c3efe453863739c1fb68fd9bd1beff214f/src/librustc_typeck/coherence/inherent.rs#L300-L303"><code class="highlighter-rouge">add_lint</code> call</a> looks like this:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">self</span><span class="py">.tcx.sess</span><span class="nf">.add_lint</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nn">lint</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="nn">builtin</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="n">OVERLAPPING_INHERENT_IMPLS</span><span class="p">,</span>
                       <span class="n">node_id</span><span class="p">,</span>
                       <span class="k">self</span><span class="py">.tcx</span><span class="nf">.span_of_impl</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">item1</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nf">.unwrap</span><span class="p">(),</span>
                       <span class="n">msg</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We want to convert this into an error. In some cases, there may be an
existing error for this scenario. In others, we will need to allocate
a fresh diagnostic
code. <a href="rustc-diagnostic-code.html">Instructions for allocating a fresh diagnostic code can be found here.</a>
You may want to mention in the extended description that the compiler
behavior changed on this point, and include a reference to the
tracking issue for the change.</p>

<p>Let’s say that we’ve adopted <code class="highlighter-rouge">E0592</code> as our code. Then we can change
the <code class="highlighter-rouge">add_lint()</code> call above to something like:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nd">struct_span_err!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">self</span><span class="py">.tcx.sess</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">self</span><span class="py">.tcx</span><span class="nf">.span_of_impl</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">item1</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="nf">.unwrap</span><span class="p">(),</span> <span class="n">msg</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="nf">.emit</span><span class="p">();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="update-tests">Update tests</h4>

<p>Finally, run the test suite. These should be some tests that used to
reference the <code class="highlighter-rouge">overlapping_inherent_impls</code> lint, those will need to be
updated. In general, if the test used to have
<code class="highlighter-rouge">#[deny(overlapping_inherent_impls)]</code>, that can just be removed.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>./x.py test
</code></pre></div></div>
